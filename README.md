# PythonSSE
This Repo contains a set of example files that can be used to learn how to integrate Python and Qlik Sense using Server Side Extensions (also called Advanced Analytics Integration). Qlik Sense has support for this functionality only in the most recent (as of 8/28/2017) version of Qlik Sense.
